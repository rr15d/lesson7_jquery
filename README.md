### Project Description:
In this assignment, the student learns how jQuery works through the use of it to create a drop-down list of ingredients and cooking directions for brownies.  The student then used a JavaScript console Pane to examine numerous jQuery functions, and also created a second clone of the index.html file which was used to create a more advanced version of the drop-down lists, using hovering and animation rather than the typical "click to display".

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery is defined as a "free, open-source JavaScript library".  jQuery provides methods for web features which make JavaScript programming easier.  jQuery functions will work across all browsers.
2. Every jQuery statement begins with the dollar sign '$'.  The $ specifies that any code that follows after it should be interpreted using the library for jQuery.
3. The CSS selector is used to select elements when using jQuery.  One can simply select the element using $("[insert element name here]").  For selecting elements in a class, one must use $("[insert element name here].[insert class name here]").  If one wants to select an element with an id, one must use $("#[insert id here]").
